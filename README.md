How to run automation scenario
1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure already installed ruby
3. Make sure already installed bundler (capybara, cucumber, etc)
4. To run automation scenario just typing 'cucumber' on terminal

Pros & Cons:
Pros:
- I setup the automation framework on local and it's worked
- I have finished web automation and already running the scenario in local. The result is passed

Cons:
- Unfortunately, I can't complete/finished API automation because I've got some issues when push commit (error message "error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/dendyyp/automation-test.git'" so I should fix that error and it takes time
- I've got some issues related with my ruby version and Gemfile too
- I just started the test at 20.30 because of a squad meeting
- Everything that happens makes time run out (waste of time)

I just do my best to finished the test but time is limited. Thank you Ruangguru for the opportunity, and I accept all the results that will happen
