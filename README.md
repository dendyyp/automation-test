Ruangguru SEiT test assignment

## Prerequisite
1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure already installed ruby
3. Make sure already installed bundler (capybara, cucumber, etc)

## Run automation scenario in local
To run automation scenario just typing 'cucumber' on terminal. For example 
>$ cucumber

## Advantages & Disadvantages:

## Advantages:
- I setup the automation framework on local and it's work properly
- I have finished web automation and already running the scenario in local. The result is passed (attached)

## Disadvantages:
- Unfortunately, I can't complete/finished API automation because I've got some issues when push commit (error message "error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/dendyyp/automation-test.git'") so I should fix that error and it takes time but I've been already check it/hit the endpoint with Postman (attached)
- I've got some issues related with my ruby version and Gemfile too
- I just started the test at 20.30 after squad meeting
- Everything that happens makes time run out (waste of time)

I just do my best to finished the test but time is limited. Thank you Ruangguru for the opportunity.
